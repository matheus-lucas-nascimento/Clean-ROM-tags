# Clean-ROM-tags
A bat archive created to cleanup ROM tags (like USA, Europe and such) and only keep the name of the rom and the format of the same gb, gba or gbc on it.

It's a fun side project to clean file ROM names to easily scrape their covers and such for emulators front-end softwares like ES-DE.
